		<h1>First Page</h1>
		<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
		<h2>Let's Talk About Headings</h2>
			<p>Headings make it easy for your site's visitors to understand the information contained on your site, much like headings do in a book.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Lists</h2>
			<p>Lists make it easy to concisely present data to readers, such as this Unordered List below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Unordered List is denoted by "ul" inside angle brackets</li>
				<li>Each list item belongs in its own "li" element</li>
			</ul>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
			<p>Ordered Lists display information in a numerically-ordered list, such as this Ordered List:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ordered Lists are extremely similar.</li>
				<li>They still contain "li" elements, but they're wrapped in an "ol" tag</li>
			</ol>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Emphasis</h2>
			<p><em>Sometimes,</em> you need a little extra zhuzh on some text to draw the reader's eye to it. This is done with "em".</p>
			<p>You can accomplish the same thing with <strong> BOLD </strong> text, using the strong command.</p>
			<p>Just because you <em><strong>can</strong></em> doesn't mean you <em><strong>should</strong></em>, though- CSS is probably better for handling that.
